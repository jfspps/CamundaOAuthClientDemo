# Camunda Client and OAuth2

This demo project is Spring MVC client to a [Camunda Workflow engine](https://github.com/jfspps/CamundaOAuthResourceServerDemo) 
that functions as the resource server and can be secured behind an OAuth identity provider. The resource server is 
configured to work with Keycloak 18.

## Local Testing

The client is running on port 8080, the authorisation server on 8083 and resource server on 8081
